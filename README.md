The ones which start with Runxx_ are the ones that have been used in the paper. I recommend that you run them in order from Run00_ to Run08_  because some of the programs may need information from the previous ones but when you did it for one time, you can re-run any of them.
Some for example Run07_ takes more time; be patient so that it be executed completely.
