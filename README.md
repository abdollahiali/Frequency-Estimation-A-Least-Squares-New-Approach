# Frequency-Estimation-A-Least-Squares-New-Approach
Matlab programs for "Frequency Estimation: A Least-Squares New Approach"  paper (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5665784/)



The ones which start with Runxx_ are the ones that have been used in the paper. I recommend that you run them in order from Run00_ to Run08_  because some of the programs may need information from the previous ones but when you did it for one time, you can re-run any of them.
Some for example Run07_ takes more time; be patient so that it be executed completely.

I have created this public repository several years after the publication of the paper and I tried my best that I collect the final versions of the programs that have been used in the paper. But there is no guaranty that they are exactly those that have been used in the paper. So if you are going to use them, please inspect them and get help from the paper in your inspection.
